This is a simple Expense Tracker web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to add their expenses by entering a description, amount, and category. All expenses are displayed in a list below the form, and the total expense is calculated automatically. This project provides an easy way to keep track of personal spending and can be enhanced with features like deleting or editing expenses, filtering by category, or saving data for later use
